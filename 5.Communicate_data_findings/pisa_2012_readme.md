# PISA examÂ´s result analysis in non-OECD counrtries
## by (Xabier Laibarra)


## Dataset

> The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an exam that measures the Mathematics, Science and Reading level of students that are 15-16 years old and it takes place every three years.

> This dataset contains information about around 500,000 students who made the PISA exam in 2012. The dateset provides a total of 635 variables, where it is possible to find the results of the exam in Mathematics, Science and Reading and a lot of further information about the personal background and characteristics of the students.

> For the analyisis in these reporst I just used the non-OECD countries and about 25 variables, which follow to get an insight about the obtained results in these countries and the factors that most influence them.


## Summary of Findings

> Once we made sure that the gender proportion was balanced we have observed that female have better marks in Sience and Reading and male have better marks in Mathematics, even though there is not a big difference.
After this, we have checked if there is any difference between the overall scores of the students born in 1996 and in 1997. As we the only countries that had students born in 1997 were Peru and Thailand we compared just this two countries. The result was, that in both of the the results were better for the older students.

> Another fact is that the Chinese Taipei has the best marks in the three subjects. We have plotted the results for each subject (and the overall score) by country in a box plot and we have also observed that the trend is not only for the Chinese Taipei, it keeps being stable for all the countries, that would have a very similar position in a ranking made by subject for all of them. 

> A very surprising fact is the relationship between the lack of interest of the Chinese Taipei students in Mathematics, which is the highest (45% of *strongly disagree*) and the scores, which are the highest among all the countries analyzed in this report. On the other hand, there is Jordan, which has the highest rate regarding the interest in Maths (*strongly agree* and *agree* percentages) but the corresponding scores are the lowest.

> Another interesting finding is, that the students who do not speak the language of the test at home have better results in all the subjects than those that they do. We also have to mention that the sample of students who speak other language at home is much smaller than the one of the students who speak the exam language at home. 

> Other remarkable results are the high scores corresponding to class sizes between 40-45 students(which is a big number) and which goes against the logic. However, we can see in the bar plot below that the Chinese Taipei, the country with best results, has the biggest class sizes. This fact is a contradiction against the traditional thinking that smaller class sizes bring better results, hence, higher scores.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I focus on the obtained scores in Mathematics, Science and Reading. In order to analyze the overall results, I introduce different variables and i visualize their impact on the results. This procedure was repeated with country, gender, class size, home language, interest in mathematicas and discipline climate, so it is easier to see the impact they have. For this differente plots and colors were used.
